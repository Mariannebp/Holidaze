## Description

Holidaze is a marketplace website for renting and renting out housing. When registering, users may choose to register with or without a manager role. Non-registered can see the list of venues and may search through them, but only registered users can see the specific venues and make bookings to them.

On this site the users may do the following:
- View a list of venues
- Search for a specific venue
- A new user with a @stud.noroff.no email may register (regular or manager role)
- A registered user may log in and out
- A registered user may update their avatar
- A registered user may view a specific venue
- A registered user may view a calendar showing available dates
- A registered user may create a booking at a venue
- Managers may also create bookings to the own venues
- A registered user may view their upcoming bookings
- A registered user with manager role may create a new venue
- A registered user with manager role may update a venue they own
- A registered user with manager role view bookings made on a venue they own
- A registered user with manager role may delete a venue they own
